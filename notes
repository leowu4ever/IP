0-9 numbers

You have to training your model/classfier first 
and it is very important

training parameters using Baum-Welch

Lastling evaluate with gesture with the trained model

input representation affects its performance

may need preprocessor to extract important information or get rid of noise

second, 







Fast fourier transform FFT get rid of noise 


x,y,z -> roll pitch and yaw 

Left right model

now generating codewords or states 1. vector quantization

nearest-neighbour condition
